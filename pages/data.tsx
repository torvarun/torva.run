          <P>The following are miscellaneous data visualizations I have worked on over the past few years. I tend to design my charts in a similar fashion to those featured in FiveThrityEight, The Ringer, or New York Times.</P>

            <P>Developed for a <A href="www.thereckoner.ca/demar-derozan-underrated-never-overlooked/">Reckoner article</A>, the first visualization is a shot chart of DeMar DeRozan from halfway through the 2016-17 NBA season. It was created with R (ggplot2), using data scraped (using the Python library BeautifulSoup) from the NBA Stats website. Shot location charts us to see where an offensive player takes (and makes) most of their shots; with this visualization, it's easy to see how proficient DeRozan is at the midrange shot, a rarity in today's NBA. Furthermore, the single-coordinate rug plots allows us to see that he is most successful at creating shots along the baseline.

            <P>This scatter plot created using D3.js shows the change in regular-season performace with/without Steph Curry for players on the 2017-18 Golden State Warriors.

          <div id="force">
            <P>The following force graph shows the common line pairings between Toronto Maple Leafs forwards during rhe first two months of the 2016-17 season. The size of the cirlce is proportional to a player's average time on ice, while the thickness of the lines is indicative of the lines represents the average time on ice a pair of players spend on the ice together. Colours represent the most common line pairings. It was developed using D3.js with data from Daily Faceoff.</P>

It was developed for an article in <A href="https://www.thereckoner.ca/serge-ibaka-missing-in-action/">The Reckoner of MGCI.</A></P>
